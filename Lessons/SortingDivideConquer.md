## Divide-and-Conquer Recursion

### Topics
- [Divide-and-conquer]&nbsp;[recursion]: divide, conquer, combine
- Revisit [binary search] to see how it divides and conquers
- [Merge sort] and [merge algorithm]

### Resources
- Play with VisuAlgo's [interactive sorting visualizations][VisuAlgo sorting] including merge sort
- Play with USF's [interactive sorting animations][USF sorting] including merge sort
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's articles on [merge sort, part 1: how it works][BaseCS merge sort 1] and [part 2: logarithms and complexity analysis][BaseCS merge sort 2] with beautiful drawings and excellent analysis
- Watch Harvard's [merge sort video] and [sorting algorithms summary video]
- Watch HackerRank's [merge sort tutorial video] (*spoiler alert:* contains solution code)
- Watch Mike Bostock's [merge sort visualization] with array values encoded using angle
- Watch Toptal's [sorting animations] to see how algorithms compare based on input and read the discussion section
- Watch dancers perform [merge sort with German folk dance]
- Watch videos to observe patterns: [9 sorting algorithms], [15 sorting algorithms], [23 sorting algorithms]
- Review Make School's [algorithm analysis slides] for a running time comparison of merge sort and bubble sort

### Challenges
- Implement merge sort algorithm and merge helper function using [sorting starter code]:
    - Implement `merge(items1, items2)` that merges lists `items1` and `items2`, each assumed to already be in sorted order, and return a new list containing all items in sorted order
    - Implement `split_sort_merge(items)` that uses any *other* sorting algorithm to sort sublists (*non-recursively*)
        - Use the [divide-and-conquer] problem-solving strategy:
            1. Divide: split problem (input list) into subproblems (two sublists each of half size)
            2. Conquer: solve subproblems independently (sort sublists with any sorting algorithm)
            3. Combine: combine subproblem solutions together (merge sorted sublists into one list)
    - Implement `merge_sort(items)` that *recursively calls itself* to sort sublists during the conquer step
        - Remember to add a base case to avoid infinite recursion loops (*hint:* very small lists are always sorted)
- Run `python sorting.py` to test sorting algorithms on random samples of integers, for example:
    ```
    $ python sorting.py merge_sort 10 20
    Initial items: [3, 15, 4, 7, 20, 6, 18, 11, 9, 7]
    Sorting items with merge_sort(items)
    Sorted items:  [3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20]
    ```
    - Experiment with different *list sizes* to find when iterative sorting algorithms are slow and merge sort is fast
- Annotate functions with complexity analysis of running time (operations) and space (memory usage)
- Expand the [sorting unit tests] to ensure your integer sorting algorithms are robust
    - Write tests in a way that lets you add new sorting functions without needing to write more tests
    - Include a variety of test cases that cover several integer distributions, orderings, and edge cases
- Run `pytest sorting_test.py` to run the [sorting unit tests] and fix any failures

### Stretch Challenges
- Reduce the space complexity (memory usage) of merge sort by avoiding some list copying
- Implement [bucket sort] or [sample sort] for integers using divide-and-conquer recursion
